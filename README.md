## [Roguelikes: A Brief History](https://esccoding.github.io/Roguelikes-A-Brief-History/)

This project was a Critical Thinking Assignment given in my CSC200 // Computer Science Fundamentals course at Colorado State University Global,
and was my first time working with HTML and CSS.

The instructions for the assignment were to create a webpage using HTML based on a theme of our choice. The scope of the assignment was simply 
to create a link to another webpage about our topic, create two lists -- one <em>ordered</em>, one <em>unordered</em> -- each containing at 
least 4 things related to our topic; and to include a picture about our topic.

TL;DR - I ended up going overboard and expanding the scope of this assignment into a full-blown research paper on the history of
Roguelikes.

Today's definition of the term "roguelike" is hotly contested. Some camps claim that "true" roguelikes are only those that contain elements 
and characteristics identical to the original <em>Rogue</em>, from which the genre derives its name (i.e., turn-based, grid-based, 
procedurally-generated dungeon-crawler featuring "permadeath"); others claim that simply containing any combination of Rogue's elements will
suffice, while others, still, believe the true definition of a "roguelike" is some secret third thing.

Regardless of which camp you may fall into, this paper only concerns itself with the games that are considered to be direct descendants
of <em>Rogue</em> (with the exception of <em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em>, which preceded <em>Rogue</em> and from which
it -- and many other genres -- actually drew inspiration).

Thank you for taking the time to view my webpage and read my paper -- I hope you enjoy it!
